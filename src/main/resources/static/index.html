Want bold text?
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
There's a wrong way and a right way. Always use the right way!

<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
